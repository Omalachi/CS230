Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Chat Away, a social media company, was the client. They aimed to expand their reach by creating a mobile app version of their website that could be released on both the Android and iPhone app stores. Keeping within a strict budget and meeting the project timeline were major priorities for them.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel I did a good job emphasizing the relative advantages and disadvantages of each potential solution, helping to weigh the options thoughtfully.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document helped by allowing for project discovery early on—laying out possible directions and evaluating the trade-offs of each. The real challenge was recognizing the right point at which enough exploration had been completed to move forward confidently.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part, it would be the evaluation of platform options where I overlooked important security considerations. Secure coding practices and security planning should always be front and center, and I would ensure these were fully integrated into my analysis.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I based the design on the understanding that meeting the user’s needs is critical; if the app doesn't meet expectations, users will quickly switch to alternatives. Keeping users engaged and delighted with the product is essential not just for initial adoption, but for long-term retention—even among the most loyal users.
